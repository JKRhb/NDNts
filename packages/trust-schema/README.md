# @ndn/trust-schema

This package is part of [NDNts](https://yoursunny.com/p/NDNts/), Named Data Networking libraries for the modern web.

This package implements trust schemas.
As a starting point, there is a simple `HierarchicalVerifier` to verify packets according to hierarchical trust model.
Schematized trust will be implemented in the future.
