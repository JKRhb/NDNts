# @ndn/quic-transport

This package is part of [NDNts](https://yoursunny.com/p/NDNts/), Named Data Networking libraries for the modern web.

This package implements an HTTP/3 client transport using experimental [WebTransport API](https://web.dev/webtransport/) in Chromium browser.
It requires [NDN-QUIC gateway](https://github.com/yoursunny/NDN-QUIC-gateway) to translate between HTTP3-over-QUIC and UDP.
