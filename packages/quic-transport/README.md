# @ndn/web-bluetooth-transport

This package is part of [NDNts](https://yoursunny.com/p/NDNts/), Named Data Networking libraries for the modern web.

This package implements a QUIC client transport using experimental [QuicTransport API](https://web.dev/quictransport/) in Chromium browser.
It requires [NDN-QUIC gateway](https://github.com/yoursunny/NDN-QUIC-gateway) to translate between QUIC and UDP.
