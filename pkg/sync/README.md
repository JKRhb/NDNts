# @ndn/sync

This package is part of [NDNts](https://yoursunny.com/p/NDNts/), Named Data Networking libraries for the modern web.

This is a transitional package that re-exports dataset synchronization and pubsub protocols from these packages:

* `@ndn/psync`: PSync and syncps
* `@ndn/svs`: StateVectorSync and SVS-PS

These re-exports are deprecated.
Please import desired functionality from the above packages directly.
